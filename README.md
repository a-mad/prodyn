ProDyn - Protein Dynamics Prediction Tasks

### ProDyn0
Conformational mechanics of point-mutated calponin homology domains, CH1 and CH2, connected by a tether. Different steered and fixed residues are assigned for molecular dynamics simulation of domain stretching behavior. Input is defined as a graph with node features (residue type, secondary structure, and properties), edge features (dihedrals, h-bonds, steer-to-fixed distance), and edge connections. Output is of two types: (1) force mode classification and (2) max force magnitude and time.
